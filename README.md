## This repo is now NOT MAINTAINED. ##

It's been a lovely journey but there are now better options out there and I've personally not used this library is years and years and years.

To be fair to the community, there will be no further support and effort here.

Keep smiling and be kind to one another ðŸ‘‹ ðŸš€
